    * Lens
    * Sifter

    * `RecipeBuilder setMaximumTier(int maximumTier);`

This is useful to keep secondary ingredients stocked for manual crafting and will be useful for automation support in a future update.

    * http://artisan-worktables.readthedocs.io
  * BREAKING CHANGES:
    * the import `mods.artisanworktables.IRecipeBuilder` has moved to `mods.artisanworktables.builder.RecipeBuilder`; note the change in the package as well as the removal of the `I`
    * all config files have been moved into the subfolder `artisanworktables`
    * all tool by type ore dict groups have been renamed, ie. `<ore:masons_chisel>` is now `<ore:artisansChisel>`
    * all tool item names have changed, ie. `<artisanworktables:masons_chisel_iron>` is now `<artisanworktables:artisans_chisel_iron>`
  * Added: json files to define tool materials (#64)
    * Tool materials have been removed from the tool module config file, instead use the `Custom` tool material json file to add / remove tool materials.
    * The file `artisanworktables.module.Tools.Materials.Generated.json` will be regenerated from the defaults each time the app is launched; you may reference this file, but don't edit it - it will be overwritten.
    * Any edits to the file `artisanworktables.module.Tools.Materials.Custom.json` will be read during initialization and tools will be generated using the defined materials.
  * Added: the table text highlight color can now be changed via the config file or the in-game config menu (#75)
  * Added: support for ingredientOr (#68)
  * Added: ore dict groups for tools by material type; the ore dict keys can be changed in the tool material json config file (#74)
  * Added: `AWItemCraftEvent.Post` post craft event (#72)
  * Added: config option to:
    * change tool material group ore dict prefix
    * change tool type group ore dict prefix
    * disable all tool material ore dict groups
    * disable all tool type ore dict groups
  * Added: can now copy existing recipes to worktable recipes (#69, gigitty):
    * Note: this *will not* work to copy recipes added by ZenScript, only with recipes that exist *before* ZenScript recipes are added
    * `RecipeBuilder#setCopy(Copy)` - copy a recipe's input and output, see documentation
  * Changed: if a player is too far away from a table to use it, the table's tab will no longer display in the gui
  * Changed: if a player is too far away from the toolbox to use it, its gui will no longer be displayed
  * Changed: removed profession distinction from tool names, ie. `Mason's Chisel` is now `Artisan's Chisel` (#76)
  * Changed: recipes without tools are now allowed, simply omit the call to `addTool` (#50,#82)
  * Changed: bone tool recipes now use the `bone` ore dict entry (#70)
  * Changed: factored out and exposed limited API package to complete (#72), API Version 1 - subject to change, build against this at your own risk
  * Changed: updated de_de.lang (PR#83 Xaikii)
  * Deprecated:
    * `Worktable.createRecipeBuilder(String)` will be removed in a future version - instead, import `mods.artisanworktables.builder.RecipeBuilder` and call `RecipeBuilder.get(String)`
    * the entire import `mods.artisanworktables.Worktable` and all its methods will be removed in a future version - use the recipe builder instead
  * Requires: Athenaeum >= 1.12.6

---

1.15.27

  * Fixed: compatibility issue with lib Athenaeum 1.12.6+

---

1.15.26

  * Changed: updated zh_cn.lang (PR#84 DYColdWind)

---

1.15.25

  * Fixed: Unable to craft item when recipe is put in by another player (#79)

---

1.15.24

  * Fixed: NoClassDefFoundError: com/codetaylor/mc/artisanworktables/modules/worktables/gui/GuiContainerBase (#78)

---

1.15.23

  * IMPORTANT: This update will break existing worktable and workstation tile entities. To reduce the number of classes used, type information is now stored in the tile entity. Preexisting tiles will not have this information and, when loaded, will adopt type 0, which translates to the Tailor type. This means existing tables and stations in a world will look the same, but behave as a Tailor's table or station. Breaking a table or station and placing it again should reset its tile entity.
  * Added: Workshops!
    * Workshops are third tier worktables. They can support recipes that use up to three tools and nine secondary ingredients.
    * All recipes share the same recipe pool, therefore, any recipe defined for a worktable or workstation will also work in a workshop. If a recipe is defined that uses a pattern larger than a 3x3 crafting grid, or three tools, it will only be craftable in the new workshops.
  * Added: additional error reporting to the ZenScript RecipeBuilder
  * Changed: rope handle texture on the side of the Mechanical Toolbox now matches the Toolbox's rope handle texture
  * Changed: ZenScript RecipeBuilder#create() now resets the builder
  * Changed: ZenScript RecipeBuilder#create() now returns the recipe builder, allowing method chaining
  * Changed: updated de_de.lang (PR#63,PR#65 Xaikii)

---

1.14.23

  * Fixed: Workstation shows wrong internal tank capacity in JEI (#62)

---

1.14.22

  * Added: experience and level requirement / cost to recipes
  * Added: new ZenScript builder methods
    * `setExperienceRequired(int)` - set experience requirement for the recipe (optional)
    * `setLevelRequired(int)` - set level requirement for the recipe (optional)
    * `setConsumeExperience(boolean)` - recipe will consume / not consume experience (optional, default: true)
  * Changed: JEI will now consider items in the secondary ingredient slots as part of the player inventory. This means that, when transferring items, JEI will take into account items in these slots.
  * Requires: Athenaeum >= 1.9.5

---

1.13.22

  * Changed: updated zh_cn.lang (PR#60 DYColdWind)

---

1.13.21

  * Added: Workstations!
    * Workstations are second tier worktables. They can support recipes that use up to two tools and nine secondary ingredients. 
    * All recipes share the same recipe pool, therefore, any recipe defined for a worktable will also work in a workstation. If a recipe is defined that uses two tools or one to nine secondary ingredients, it will only be craftable in the new workstations.
    * Recipes can be defined to require multiple secondary ingredients of the same type. For example, `<minecraft:clay_ball> * 8`, would require consuming 8 clay balls to complete the recipe.
    * JEI recipe transfer will transfer items to the 3x3 crafting grid and tools to the two tool slots, however, it will not transfer items to the secondary ingredient slots. This is intentional. Firstly, JEI has a limitation in that it will only transfer one of each item unless shift is held while clicking the transfer button. The second drawback is that when JEI does the recipe transfer, it will clear all other slots that are not used in the recipe. This means that any secondary ingredients that you have stored in the slots will be returned to your inventory. This is inconvenient. 
  * Added: new ZenScript builder methods
    * `addTool(IIngredient, int)`
    * `setSecondaryIngredients(IIngredient[])`
  * Added: fr_fr.lang (PR#56 Okii35)
  * Changed: new models and textures for the worktables
  * Changed: deprecated ZenScript builder methods
    * `setTool(IIngredient, int)` - use `addTool(IIngredient, int)` instead
  * Changed: updated de_de.lang (PR#58 Xaikii)
  * Fixed: JEI recipe transfer issue with some converted oreDict ingredients
  * Fixed: stacks in secondary output slots are not dropped when the block is broken
  * Note: you will need to refresh the config for the worktable module
  * Requires: Athenaeum >= 1.8.4

---

1.12.21

  * Fixed: crash with liquid in GUI (or invisible items w/ optifine) (#52)
  * Fixed: tertiary and quaternary chanced outputs not set properly with legacy zen methods
  * Changed: refactor of the gui / container code (internal prep)
  * Changed: changed recipes to handle multiple tools (internal prep)
  * Note: This is being released as an alpha because it changes several internal systems. New features will be built using the new changes and it is important to quickly catch and eliminate any bugs that have been introduced by the refactoring. If you would like to help speed the development process and ensure a stable product, please report any issues you find with this version. Thank you!
  * Requires: Athenaeum >= 1.7.4

  * Fixed: fluid cleared via GUI remains after re-load (#49)
  * Changed: updated de_de.lang (PR#46 Xaikii) 

---

1.11.20

  * Added: Mechanical Toolbox!
    * This new toolbox will automatically swap old tools for new tools. When a tool is broken,
      or lacks sufficient durability to complete the last successful craft, the Mechanical
      Toolbox will swap a new, appropriate tool into the worktable's tool slot.
  * Added: config option to require sufficient tool durability (#44)
  * Added: durability tooltip to all tools from this mod
  * Added: config option to disable the durability tooltip
  * Note: you will probably need to refresh the config for the tools and the toolbox
